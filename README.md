# Multivariate Electricity Consumption Prediction with Extreme Learning Machine
In this paper, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is
demonstrated to be a powerful tool for electricity consumption
prediction based on its competitive prediction accuracy and superior
computational speed compared to Support Vector Machine
(SVM). Moreover, ELM is utilized to investigate the potentials
of using auxiliary information such as electricity-related factors
and environmental factors to augment the prediction accuracy
obtained by purely using the electricity consumption factors.
Furthermore, we formulate a combinatorial optimization problem
of seeking an optimal subset of auxiliary factors and their
corresponding optimal window sizes using the most suitable ELM
structure, and propose a Discrete Dynamic Multi-Swarm Particle
Swarm Optimization (DDMS-PSO) to address this problem.
Experimental studies on a real-world building dataset demonstrate
that electricity-related factors improve accuracy while
environmental factors further boost accuracy. By using DDMSPSO,
we find a subset of electricity-related and environmental
factors, their respective window sizes, and the number of hidden
neurons in ELM which leads to the best prediction accuracy.
